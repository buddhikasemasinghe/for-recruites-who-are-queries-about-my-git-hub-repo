# For the recruiters who asks me about my git hub repo
This is for the people who would judge me based on my Git hub repo which is one of the main requirement in the job advertisment.

## FolI belive what most of the hard core programmers/developers would do following things
### They would slef learn something and they most likely wont push in Git hub
### If you wish to know how much the developer is interest about new tech, then ask him to share his you tube/ medium history.
### I have learned so many thing last few months but I do not want to push it to Git hub or Gitlab as I want to be a slef learning and git hub is not a Facebook.
