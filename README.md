# For the recruiters who asks me about my git hub repo
This is for the people who would judge me based on my Git hub repo which is one of the main requirement in the job advertisment.

## I belive that  most of the hard core programmers/developers would do following things
### They would self learn something and they most likely won't push in Git hub.
### If you wish to know how much the developer is interested about new stack, then ask him to share his you tube/ medium history instead of asking cloining repos.
### I have learned so many thing last few months but I do not want to push it to Git hub or Gitlab as I want to be a self learner and git hub is not a Facebook.
